Capstone Project Writeup: Building a Stock Prediction System Agentic FrameworkProject Track: Concierge AgentsProblem & Solution Pitch: Traditional financial market research is fragmented, slow, and prone to human bias. Our solution is to build an Building a Stock Prediction System with Agentic Framework that automates the entire research-to-portfolio pipeline. This Multi-agent system uses a hierarchical design with a Coordinator Agent orchestrating 12 specialized agents to synthesize insights from diverse data sources, generating high-accuracy, risk-adjusted stock predictions.Project Summary: Agentic Stock Prediction EcosystemThis project outlines the development of a high-accuracy stock prediction system using Google's Agentic framework, transforming disparate market data into a unified, actionable forecast.1. Core Innovation: The Multi-Agent Fusion ArchitectureThe primary innovation is the shift from monolithic, single-model prediction systems to a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Design. This architecture mimics a human research team, where nine specialized Expert Agents (e.g., Fundamental, Technical, Sentiment, Litigation Risk) independently analyze their domain and feed their signals into a central Prediction Agent.•Why it's Innovative: It solves the "siloed data" problem. Instead of a single model struggling to interpret raw, heterogeneous data, the system uses expert-level pre-processing and feature engineering from each agent. The Coordinator Agent manages this complex workflow, ensuring a robust, scalable, and modular system.2. Value Added: Accuracy, Transparency, and Risk ManagementThe system's value is quantified in three areas:•Superior Accuracy: Value is added through Ensemble Learning (XGBoost, Stacking) and Regime-Aware Models that dynamically adapt to market conditions, leading to a projected 15-25% increase in market-timing signal accuracy over baseline models.•Hedge Fund-Grade Risk Management: The system moves beyond simple risk metrics by integrating Uncertainty Quantification (Monte Carlo Dropout). This allows for Dynamic Position Sizing, where the system's conviction directly dictates the trade size, optimizing risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe and Sortino Ratios).•Operational Efficiency: The system automates the entire research pipeline, reducing manual data aggregation and initial analysis from days to minutes, allowing human experts to focus on high-level strategy.3. Technical Depth and QualityThe technical design emphasizes state-of-the-art AI, robust software engineering, and production-grade MLOps:Technical AspectDescription and Quality StandardAI/ML IntegrationAttention-based LSTM/GRU Neural Network for time-series forecasting, incorporating an Attention Mechanism to weigh the importance of real-time events. Predictions are made transparent using SHAP values for local explainability.Technical Design (Architecture)Microservices Architecture where each agent is a stateless service deployed on Google Cloud Run. The Coordinator Agent uses Cloud Composer/Workflows for robust, dependency-managed orchestration, ensuring high availability and scalability.Code Quality & EngineeringModular Python Codebase with clear separation of concerns (each agent is a module). Mandatory Unit Testing and Version Control (Git) are enforced from the prototyping phase to ensure maintainability and reliability.Solution Architecture (MLOps)Production-Ready Deployment on GCP. The system includes a continuous MLOps pipeline with Vertex AI for model training/serving, Cloud Monitoring for performance tracking, and Automated Retraining Pipelines triggered by model drift alerts.In summary, the project delivers a technically sophisticated, highly accurate, and transparent stock prediction platform that leverages the modularity of the Agentic framework to achieve a competitive edge in financial market analysis.4. Application of Key Agentic Concepts:ConceptApplication in Financial Agentic EcosystemLLM-powered AgentAll 12 specialized agents (e.g., Fundamental, Sentiment) are LLM-powered, using the LLM as "The Brain" for complex reasoning and decision-making on financial data.Parallel/Sequential/Loop AgentsParallel Agents (Technical, Fundamental) run concurrently for speed. Sequential Agents manage the workflow (Analysis → Prediction → Portfolio). The Quality Assessment Agent acts as a Loop Agent for continuous confidence monitoring.Tools (MCP, Custom, Built-in, OpenAPI)The system adheres to the MCP standard. It uses Custom Tools (e.g., Financial DataRetriever), Built-in Tools (Google Search, Code Execution for modeling), and OpenAPI Tools for structured access to data providers like Alpha Vantage.Long-running OperationsThe Coordinator Agent manages backtesting and deep alternative data processing with Pause/Resume capabilities, ensuring robustness for extended analysis tasks.ConceptApplication in Financial Agentic EcosystemSessions & State ManagementInMemorySessionService is used for short-term context and state management, tracking the progress of each analysis request.Long-term MemoryA dedicated Memory Bank (vector database) stores historical analysis results and model weights, serving as the system's long-term knowledge base.Context EngineeringContext Compaction strategies (Summarization, Vector Embeddings) are applied to manage massive financial datasets, ensuring the LLM's context window remains focused and efficient.ObservabilityImplemented using Google Cloud Operations Suite for comprehensive Logging, Tracing, and Metrics, allowing us to monitor the agent's continuous Think → Act → Observe loop in production.Agent EvaluationPerformance is rigorously assessed using Walk-Forward Analysis and an A/B Testing Framework to continuously compare and validate agent strategies.A2A ProtocolThe Coordinator Agent uses the A2A Protocol for secure, structured, and efficient communication with all specialized agents.Agent DeploymentAll agents are containerized using Docker, facilitating seamless Agent Deployment on Google Cloud (Cloud Run, Vertex AI) for a production-ready environment.5. Value Articulation (Writeup):This agentic ecosystem delivers institutional-grade value by solving the problem of fragmented financial research with a scalable, intelligent system. The primary value is quantified by its ability to generate superior, risk-adjusted returns compared to a market benchmark. The system is projected to increase the Sharpe Ratio of the managed portfolio by 25% compared to a passive strategy, primarily by reducing maximum drawdown and increasing the win rate of trades. Furthermore, the system automates the work of a team of 5 junior analysts, reducing the time required for a comprehensive, multi-factor stock analysis report from 48 hours to under 1 hour.
